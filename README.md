# Demo App

This is a Python Flask app for demonstrating DevOps-y things.

## DO NOT RUN THIS IN PRODUCTION

_This app exposes some things that should never normally be exposed **by design** for demo purposes!_

## Why another demo app?

I built it out of frustration at the other demos I could find that weren't multi-arch.
